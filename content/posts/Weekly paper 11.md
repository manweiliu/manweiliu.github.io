Big data is like teenage sex: everyone talks about it, nobody really knows how to do it, everyone thinks everyone else is doing it, so everyone claims they are doing it.

[The End of Theory: The Data Deluge Makes the Scientific Method Obsolete](https://www.wired.com/2008/06/pb-theory/)

“相关不等于因果”这句话已经刻进了科学家的DNA中，George Box的这句“所有模型都是错的，但其中一些很有用。”也常挂在嘴边。
不过，在这个Petabyte时代，足够量的数据似乎能比科学家更早更快地发现未知规律。这两句名言或许有了新的形式，“相关不等于因果，但相关就够了”，以及，“所有模型都是错的，没有它们，你也越来越可能成功。”

At the petabyte scale, information is not a matter of simple three- and four-dimensional taxonomy and order but of dimensionally agnostic statistics. It calls for an entirely different approach, one that requires us to lose the tether of data as something that can be visualized in its totality.

### The fundamental principles underlying data science:

- Extracting useful knowledge from data to solve business problems can be treated systematically by following a process with reasonably well-defined stages. The Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM) is one codification of this process. 
- Evaluating data-science results requires careful consideration of the context in which they will be used. 
- The relationship between the business problem and the analytics solution often can be decomposed into tractable subproblems via the framework of analyzing expected value. 
- Information technology can be used to find informative data items from within a large body of data. 
- Entities that are similar with respect to known features or attributes often are similar with respect to unknown features or attributes. 
- If you look too hard at a set of data, you will find something—but it might not generalize beyond the data you’re observing.
- To draw causal conclusions, one must pay very close attention to the presence of confounding factors, possibly unseen ones.

Data Science is a broader field that encompasses traditional statistics but also includes other skills such as data preparation, presentation, and prediction.

### The framework of Data Science

- What is the question? Define a clear and well-posed question that can be answered using data analysis techniques.
- What is the data? Carefully consider what data are available, how they were collected, and what biases or limitations they may have.
- What is the model? Selecting an appropriate model or set of models to analyze the data, taking into account assumptions, complexity, and interpretability.
- What is the answer? Data Science is not just about fitting models to data but also about communicating results effectively and making decisions based on those results.

### Procedures for carrying out each step
1. What is the question?
	- Define the problem or question you are trying to solve
	- Identify relevant variables and data sources
	- Formulate a hypothesis or set of hypotheses that can be tested using data
2. What is the data?
	- Collect and clean data from relevant sources
	- Explore and visualize data to identify patterns, outliers, and missing values
	- Assess data quality, completeness, and representativeness
3. What is the model?
	- Select an appropriate model or set of models based on the research question and available data
	- Fit models to data using appropriate statistical techniques
	- Validate models using cross-validation or other techniques
4. What is the answer?
	- Communicate results effectively using visualizations, tables, and text summaries
	- Interpret results in light of research question and available evidence
	- Make decisions based on results, taking into account uncertainty, limitations, and potential biases.

### Aspects of data science that make it unique:

1. Scale: Data science often involves working with very large datasets that require specialized tools and techniques for storage, processing, and analysis. This requires a different set of skills and approaches than traditional scientific research.

2. Interdisciplinary nature: Data science draws on techniques and concepts from a wide range of fields, including statistics, computer science, mathematics, and domain-specific areas such as biology or economics. This interdisciplinary nature requires data scientists to be comfortable working across multiple domains and collaborating with experts from different fields.

3. Emphasis on prediction: While traditional scientific research often focuses on understanding the underlying mechanisms or causes of a phenomenon, data science is often more focused on making predictions or identifying patterns in data that can be used to inform decision-making.

4. Rapidly evolving field: Data science is a rapidly evolving field that is constantly changing as new tools and techniques are developed. This requires data scientists to be adaptable and willing to learn new skills throughout their careers.
