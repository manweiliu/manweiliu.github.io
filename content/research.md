## Working paper
:(fas fa-layer-group fa-fw): **Counteracting Narratives: Evidence from an Online Experiment**, with [Sili Zhang](www.silizhang.com), *accepted*, the Economic Journal

People are swayed by biased narratives, even when they know the bias and the random assignment of those biased narratives. Further consumption of information does not always help.

Can people counteract biased narratives with subsequent information? Using an online experiment where counteracting may have the best odds by design, we investigate this question by first randomly assigning subjects to read different narratives that contain the same facts, and then offering them the opportunity to acquire and process balanced arguments. We document three main findings. First, subjects shift their attitudes towards the standpoint of the randomly assigned narrative, knowing that the narrative is slanted and randomly assigned. Second, the opportunity to read additional arguments does not prompt subjects to counteract the persuasion effects of the initial narratives. Third, when evaluating subsequent arguments, participants find arguments aligned with the randomly assigned narrative more convincing. These findings remain qualitatively similar in additional treatments where the balanced arguments are provided two weeks after initial exposure to narratives. Only when we replace these arguments with the exact opposing narratives that subjects do not initially see are they able to fully counteract the effects. Taken together, our results highlight the importance of balanced and complete exposure at the outset in counteracting the influence of biased narratives.

:(fas fa-layer-group fa-fw): **Majority voting or dictatorship? How collective-choice rules affect institutional design and cooperation**, with Eline van der Heijden

Collective-choice rules, e.g., majority voting or dictatorship, aggregate individual choices into a collective decision. This study provides experimental evidence on how collective-choice rules affect institutional design and cooperation behavior in a social dilemma.

Collective-choice rules aggregate individual choices into a collective choice. This experimental study addresses the role of collective-choice rules in self-governance via institutional design in a social dilemma. Groups decide repeatedly on whether to establish any institution, and if so which institutions, to sustain cooperation in a public goods game. We hypothesize that collective-choice rules may directly affect cooperation, conditional on having the same institutions. They may also have an indirect effect on cooperation, via institutional choices. We implement three collective-choice rules: majority voting, dictatorship and rotating dictatorship. Our main findings are: (1) cooperation level is not higher under the institutions chosen via a democratic rule than when the same institutions are chosen via a non-democratic rule. (2) Institutional choices made via majority voting or a fixed dictator are more stable over time than those chosen by rotating dictators. (3) The instability of institutions is associated with lower cooperation level. These results have implications for the organization of small-scale group-decision.

:(fas fa-layer-group fa-fw): **The relativity of moral judgments**

You will be punished more harshly when your immoral action is contrasted with a moral one. But you will not be rewarded if your moral action is contrasted with an immoral one.

{{< admonition abstract "Abstract" false >}}
{{< version 0.2.10 >}}

Moral judgments are important factors in individual decision-making and interpersonal interactions. I examine the relativity of moral judgments, specifically, whether moral judgments toward a decision maker depend on the reference decision maker’s choice. The results of an experiment show that people punish a decision maker who chooses an immoral action more harshly when they observe another moral choice than if they observe another immoral one. A contrast effect, rather than a shift in perceived social norms, accounts for the relativity. The relativity of moral judgments suggests that there exists non-monetary spillover effects of one's action on another. The results have implications for moral behavior in markets and in other social contexts.

## Work in progress

:(fas fa-layer-group fa-fw): **Mistakes or misbeliefs? Decomposing strategic naivety about undisclosed information**, with [Tingting Wu](https://sites.google.com/view/tingtingwuecon/home)

Is no news bad news? Theories say so; otherwise it wouldn't be withheld. But people in our study behave naively as if no news suggests a mixture of good and bad news. Incorrect beliefs about their opponents cannot account for the mistakes. People simply struggle with abductive reasoning and even more with Bayesian updating.

:(fas fa-layer-group fa-fw): **When to feed the Leviathan: Trading-off between efficiency, fairness, and the intrinsic value of power**, with Yadi Yang

Are people willing to delegate decisions to a centralized institution that coerces cooperation in social dilemmas? Clearly it depends on their beliefs about others' behavior, their preferences for efficiency and fairness, and how they value decision rights, maybe? We try to identify this unobserved driving factor.
